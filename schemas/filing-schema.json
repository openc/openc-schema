  "description": "A filing is a document or set of documents published or submitted to registers or regulators by end entity. The standard example is an annual report detailing the companies activities. The filing object is for storing the meta data about the filing (e.g. filing date, filing type, title perhaps). There are also commonly associated documents with filings - often just one, but it's not unusual for there to be more than one, either because there are multiple supporting documents for the filing (e.g. SEC filings and FERC filings), or because there are multiple versions of the same file (e.g. PDF and XBRL file)",
